##  About Me

I’m a **Junior DevOps Engineer** building real-world infrastructure skills through hands-on labs, containerized environments, and cloud architecture practice.

I focus on understanding systems deeply — from networking fundamentals to scalable cloud design.

🔹 Container-first mindset  
🔹 Strong Linux foundation  
🔹 Cloud-oriented infrastructure thinking  
🔹 Automation-driven workflows

## 🏗 Homelab & Infrastructure Projects

- Designed isolated Ubuntu-based container environments for reproducible development and testing (ARM architecture)
- Designed multi-router and multi-switch topologies using Cisco Cisco Catalyst 2960, Cisco SG200-18...
- Configured static and dynamic routing (OSPF)
- Implemented VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing
- Configured trunking (802.1Q) and access layer switching
- Implemented redundancy mechanisms (STP concepts, gateway redundancy scenarios)
- Validated connectivity, failover behavior, and traffic flow through structured testing
- Modeled network segmentation scenarios including VLSM-based subnet planning and traffic isolation
- Implemented local DNS filtering and traffic control mechanisms
- Built Raspberry Pi-based infrastructure services for network-level experimentation
- Simulated deployment pipelines and failure scenarios to validate system behavior
- Practiced container lifecycle management and environment reproducibility
- Conducted troubleshooting exercises focused on networking, permissions, and service reliability

The homelab environment is used to model infrastructure behavior, validate configurations, and strengthen operational understanding under controlled conditions.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

> "the unspoken in builing phase, comes up in deployment"

> "If you can't deploy it, automate it, and scale it — you don't fully understand it."
