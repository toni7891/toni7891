##  About Me

I’m a **Junior DevOps Engineer** building real-world infrastructure skills through hands-on labs, containerized environments, and cloud architecture practice.

I focus on understanding systems deeply — from networking fundamentals to scalable cloud design.

🔹 Container-first mindset  
🔹 Strong Linux foundation  
🔹 Cloud-oriented infrastructure thinking  
🔹 Automation-driven workflows

## 🏗 Homelab & Infrastructure Projects

- Ubuntu environments via Docker (Apple Silicon ARM)
- Networking & VLSM subnetting labs
- DNS-level filtering with Pi-hole
- Raspberry Pi infrastructure experiments
- Git workflow simulations
- CI/CD practice environments
- Service deployment & troubleshooting scenarios

My homelab is where theory becomes production-style thinking.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

> "the unspoken in builing phase, comes up in deployment"

> "If you can't deploy it, automate it, and scale it — you don't fully understand it."
